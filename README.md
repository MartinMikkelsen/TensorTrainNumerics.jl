Tensor Train Numerics is a Julia package designed to provide efficient numerical methods for working with tensor trains (TT) and quantized tensor trains (QTT). 

## Getting started 

To get started with Tensor Train Numerics, you can install the package using Julia's package manager:

```Julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add("TensorTrainNumerics")
```

## Key features

- Tensor Train Decomposition: Algorithms for decomposing high-dimensional tensors into tensor train format 
- Tensor Operations: Support for basic tensor operations such as addition, multiplication, the hadamard product in tensor train format 
- Discrete Operators: Implementation of discrete Laplacians, gradient operators, and shift matrices in tensor train format for solving partial differential equations 
- Quantized Tensor Trains: Tools for constructing and manipulating quantized tensor trains, which provide further compression and efficiency for large-scale problems.
- Iterative Solvers: Integration with iterative solvers for solving linear systems and eigenvalue problems in tensor train format
- The Fourier transform in QTT format and interpolation in QTT format 
- Visualization: Basic visualization tools.
